# Traffic-Sense
‘TrafficSense Technology’ is a traffic engineering data collection and data processing solution which adopts video recognition technique to replace the current inefficient and resource-demanding manual data collection approach in the industry. 

## Advanced PCU Quantification
The adapted YOLOv8-MHA model is engineered to not only recognize and classify vehicles into 10 distinct categories but also to quantify traffic flows in terms of PCUs. This metric is critical for assessing the impact of different types of vehicles on traffic congestion and for planning purposes. By assigning PCU values to each vehicle type based on their size and the space they typically occupy on the road, the model facilitates a more nuanced analysis of traffic density and flow.

## Peak Traffic Hour Analysis
Utilizing the model's real-time processing capabilities and its detailed classification of vehicles, the system can analyze traffic volume trends throughout the day to identify peak traffic hours. This information is vital for traffic authorities to implement dynamic traffic management strategies, such as adjusting signal timings and optimizing route suggestions to alleviate congestion during these critical periods.

## Balancing Flow Between Junctions
The strategic balancing of traffic flow between junctions is another key aspect of this refined approach. By analyzing the PCU data collected from various points within the traffic network, the model assists in identifying bottlenecks and underutilized routes. This enables traffic management systems to redirect traffic more effectively, ensuring a more balanced distribution of traffic across the network, minimizing congestion, and improving overall traffic flow.
